    <h1 class="dancing-script">The Family we made in school</h1>
    <p class="jua-regular">School is more than just classes and tests; it’s about the friendships we create, the joy we experience, and the unforgettable times 
        that shape who we are. From the moment we entered our classroom as strangers to the day we felt sad about parting, every experience 
        has been valuable. Our group is unique, not only because of our connection but also because each of us contributes something special.
        Whether it was our first field trip without teachers, the thrill of book fairs, or the dance after "Pratibha Pradarshan," every 
        memory is cherished.</p>
        <br>
    <img src="./friends1.jpg" height="500px">    
    <p class="jua-regular">Our 8th-grade journey became even more special when we found out we weren’t mixed up. With Dhanya Ma’am leading us, we discovered the
         true meaning of discipline, connection, and responsibility. From secret cricket games to spontaneous singing and dancing, she was always
         there, making this year unforgettable. She was the only one in the entire school who accepted our mistakes, seeing us as kids and always
          offering her support. As we reflect on our time together, one thing is clear—no matter where life leads us, we will always stay connected.
           This website honours our amazing school days, a space to revisit those wonderful moments forever.

    <h2 class="dancing-script">My Friends:</h2>
    <ol class="jua-regular">
<li>Tanish:</li>
<img src="./Tanish.jpg" height="250px" width="200px">

<p class="jua-regular">Tanish is one of the unforgettable person in our group. He has a unique ability to offer valuable
    advice to everyone around him, making him a cherished friend. Not only is he talented at playing the mridangam and badminton, but he also
    possesses a wonderful hidden talent for writing poetry. While badminton is one of his favorite sports, he also enjoys watching and 
    playing cricket. Although he may not have a nickname, his kindness shines through in everything he does. One of the things that all the 
    guys appreciate about Tanish is his mother's delicious paneer curry.</p>
<li>Krishna:</li>
<img src="./Krishna.png" height="250px">
<p class="jua-regular">Krishna, the name is appropriate for him. He is a good hearted person and is always energetic. He is
    famously known as Jonty Rhodes.While cricket used to be his passion, his interest has waned over time. Interestingly, he can see well without glasses,
    but without them, his face remains a mystery to us. His mother's aloo paratha is simply unbeatable. Krishna is someone who loves attending weddings 
    and going on vacations, to the point where we sometimes wonder if he’s celebrating his own wedding or someone else's!</p>
<li>Mohan:</li>
<img src="./Mohan.png" height="250px">
<p class="jua-regular">Mohan is often seen as the most innocent member of our group, though we all know he puts on that act. 
    He has a talent for playing the mridangam and is quite skilled in coding. It's likely he doesn't have a nickname, but his personality 
    shines through despite his tendency to overact. He is genuinely kind and friendly. I've traveled with him so much that I feel like I know
    evrything about him. Our homes are so close that we visit each other at least twice a week.He is person thinks that I should do this today 
but always fails to do it.</p>
<li>Akhil:</li>
<img src="./akhil.png" height="250px">
<p class="jua-regular">Akhil is someone who carries so many fantasies. He has a gentle spirit and rarely lets
anger take hold. Throughout his journey, he has faced numerous challenges and triumphs. His talents shine in both badminton and throwball, showcasing his dedication.
Remarkably, he commits three hours each day to his tuition, demonstrating his determination to learn and grow. Though i don't know much about he will alwats remain 
as a special person in my life.He is always stubborn and I still don't know whats the reason.</p>

<li>Vasanth:</li>
<img src="./vasanth.png" height="250px">
<p class="jua-regular">Vasanth is the smallest and shortest member of our group. He is often referred to as a chhota packet butno bada dhamaka
    . His behavior tends to be quite childish, and he can be somewhat irritating at times. However, despite his 
    tendency to annoy, he is also very friendly. Although we occasionally exclude him from our activities, he remains an unforgettable
    presence in our lives. In front of his parents, he presents himself as very innocent, yet with us, he is the most talkative individual. 
    We often wonder how his parents manage to handle him at home.He is very good at taekwondo.</p>
<li>Prajwal:</li>
<img src="./prajwal.png" height="250px">
<p class="jua-regular">Prajwal is one of the top students in our class and stands out as the tallest among us. His nickname, "Tall Guy,"
     suits him perfectly. He has a gentle and kind nature, always ready to lend a helping hand, which makes him well-liked by everyone. 
     Prajwal excels in his studies and has a special bond with our teachers, often being their favorite. In addition to his academic 
     achievements, he also plays the piano beautifully. For lunch, he typically enjoys a simple meal of rice, curry, and papad. While we've 
     grown a bit tired of seeing the same dish for the past two years, he never seems to mind. We’re all eagerly anticipating the day he 
     surprises us with paneer curry!</p>
<li>Ria:</li>
<img src="./ria.jpg" height="250px">
<p class="jua-regular">Ria the most popular person in our group. She lits up the class with her smile and frightens the class with her big awwwww .
She has a genuinely kind spirit, and is always ready to lend a hand and offer thoughtful advice to anyone in need. Ria excels at volleyball, showcasing her
talent and passion for the game.She even has a habit of giving her smiley autographs in almost everybook even if we dont ask.She has disease of scratching
 other's classwork but thank god she scratches with pencil and not with pen.She is very unique character and i had never such person in my whole life.
She probably doesn't have any nickname but I heard people calling her baka though i don't know what does it actually mean</p>              
<li>Harshitha:</li>
<img src="./chetan.jpg"height="250px">
<p class="jua-regular">Harshitha chetan so big name right ,thats the reason we affectionately shortened it to Chetan. Most people refer to her
     as Chetan, but occasionally we call her Vada Pav, a nickname given by Krishna because of her gol gol face and this reason was also given by him itself
     . She excels academically and is the top student in our class. While she may act a bit silly at times, her sweetness and kindness shine through.She is nothing but an exact xerox
     copy of ria her bestfriend probably. She is not intrested in games but likes watching k-drama's a lot. </p>
<li>Seenchana:</li>
<img src="./seenchana.jpg" height="250px">
<p class="jua-regular">Seenchana is someone who truly needs no introduction; just looking at her picture above gives you a sense of who she is. She has a
     playful, childlike spirit and often claims to be too busy to help out, usually saying it’s because she needs to sleep.She often known as flying kathe,shinchan and sulochana
     Despite her laid-back nature, she has a talent for singing and excels in kho-kho. One thing we definitely share is our love for Hindi songs. Seenchana has a unique 
     personality and that is really weird.Even she likes watching cricket and i guess she is the only person in our class who likes watching cricket.</p>
<li>Shrusti:</li>
<img src="./shrusti.png" height="250px">
<p class="jua-regular">Shrusti is the only person who is new to our group but has already became close with everyone.She is a person who is very-hearted.She 
 never gets angry for anything easily and she is always there help anyone. I never heard her telling no to someone who ask her to do favour for her. She is person
who is much into phone and reels. She often a teacher's pet and her handwriting that needs no more explantion.She is often seen as a innocent person but she is katharnak 
ladkhi outside.</p>
<li>Aishwarya:</li>
<img src="./aishwarya.jpg" height="250px">
<p class="jua-regular">Aishwarya is person who is the only person after me who is studying from pre-kg in this school itself. She was my 
    classmate from past 5 years and she always portrayed to as a wonderful person with such a caring nature. I really thank aishu for giving me space to park my cycle
     from the starting. She is very good at dance, art , singing and mainly karate. She is always close with neighbors who all are our 
     school itself.</p>
<li>Nishitha:</li>
<img src="./nishitha.jpg" height="250px">
<p class="jua-regular">Nishitha, I have to say, that image above still makes me laugh every time I see it. She often tries to mimic Seenchana, but 
    deep down, she has such a kind heart. Most of the time, she reaches out just to ask for notes or printouts. After me, she’s the one I’ve shared
    so many printouts with. Volleyball is her favorite sport, and her playful, childlike spirit shines through, especially when she playfully pokes
     others with her pen.</p>
